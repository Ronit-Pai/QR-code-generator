## About

A basic QR code generator using javascript

---

## Extra
I have created the same project using python , to use the javascript a link will be available in the description box.

To use the python code , since it doesnt have a web support , copy the code and run the following command in the terminal 

---
 pip install qrcode[pil]
---
it will install the required libraries and dependencies , then run the program!!!.
